## What to expect during this talk

A short talk on using quantitative data to measure student success

<br>

I hope you end up with more questions than answers after this talk!

## Questions

:::{.incremental}

- What, if any, quantitivative measures predict student success?

<br>

- Can we use these measures to intervene earlier with students who would otherwise not submit work?

<br>

- Do Quantitative measures align with student perceptions of success/effort?

<br>

- Do Quantitative measures align with *our* perceptions of success/effort?

:::

## Background

:::{.incremental}


- A cohort of Biological sciences students

<br>

- Data is from a second year module on statistics and programming

<br>

- 69 students opted-in to measures of:

    - In-person attendance at workshops
    - Logged work hours
    - Participation in weekly assignments/tests

## Correlations

::: columns

```{r}

```

:::

:::{.column}

- **Coursework Days** - Time between coursework started and submitted

- **Learning Hours** - Time on system before coursework released

- **Coursework Hours** - Time on system after coursework released

- **Attendance** - In-person attendance

- **Weekly assignment** - Completion of weekly tasks/tests

## Predictive Outcomes


```{r}
#| out.width = "80%"

load("dredge-model")
summary(model.avg(best, subset = delta < 1)) |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_regression(label = c(`Coursework-time` ~ "Coursework Hours",
                            `Days of work` ~ "Coursework Days",
                            `Coursework-time:Attendance` ~ "Coursework Hours:Attendance")) |> 
                            gtsummary::as_gt() |> 
                            gt::tab_options(
                            table.font.size = 28)

```

:::{.incremental}

- Mean coursework mark 66%

- Model accounts for 60% of variance in student attainment

- Multiple candidate models were combined to produce an ensemble model that provides the most robust and reliable predictions

:::



# Non-submission {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## Probability of non-submission

- 9/69 students did not submit coursework

- Using a logistic regression model to separate coursework by submission/non-submission

- Can we use quantitative measures to identify students at risk of non-submission?

## Probability of non-submission

The first four weeks are a good indicator for risk of non-submission

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-width: 12

risk_plot + inset_element(risk_table, left = 0.61, bottom = 0.6, right = 1, top = 1.1) 

```

## Applications

::: columns

::: {.column}

**Black box - Machine learning**

:::{.fragment}

PROS

- Maximum predictive ability

- Identify and intervene with students

- Can be trained on a wide range of data

:::

:::{.fragment}

CONS


- Opaque

:::

:::

:::{.column}



**Identify key variables**

:::{.fragment}

PROS

- Transparent

- Engages students with decision making

CONS

- Less accurate

- More difficult to implement?

:::

:::

:::


## Where next

:::{.incremental}

- Studies to compare Quantitative and Qualitative measures of student success

- Evalutate student perceptions of requirements or indicators of "academic success"

- Larger scale data training to build predictive models

:::

# Wrap-up {background-color="#D9DBDB"}


- Increasing amounts of data available on student participation and engagement

- Student engagement is not as simple as "In-person attendance"

- Quantitative markers CAN be used as predictors of academic achievement
